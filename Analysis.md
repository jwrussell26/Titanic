## Introduction

When examining the improbable tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic in
1912, it is a reasonable assumption to believe that there was a
predictable pattern to who on board survived and who died. It is my
belief that women and younger passengers had a greater chance of
surviving due to those groups taking priority when filling the
lifeboats. A thorough analysis will be conducted to test this
hypothesis.
