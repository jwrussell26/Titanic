## Introduction

When examining the improbable tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, it is a reasonable assumption to believe that there was a predictable pattern to who on board survived and who died. It is my belief that women and younger passengers had a greater chance of surviving due to those groups taking priority when filling the lifeboats. A thorough analysis will be conducted to test this hypothesis.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
