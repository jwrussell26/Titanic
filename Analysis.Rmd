## Introduction

When examining the improbable tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, it is a reasonable assumption to believe that there was a predictable pattern to who on board survived and who died. It is my belief that women and younger passengers had a greater chance of surviving due to those groups taking priority when filling the lifeboats. A thorough analysis will be conducted to test this hypothesis.
